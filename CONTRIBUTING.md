# Contributing

This repository is maintained as an Orizon IT product engineering project.

## Workflow

Use the following flow:

```text
issue -> branch -> implementation -> local validation -> pull request -> review -> merge
```

Recommended branch names:

- `feature/<short-description>`
- `fix/<short-description>`
- `docs/<short-description>`
- `refactor/<short-description>`

## Commit convention

Use short Conventional Commit-style messages:

- `feat:` new capability
- `fix:` defect correction
- `docs:` documentation
- `test:` test or validation
- `refactor:` internal change without intended behavior change
- `chore:` repository/tooling maintenance
- `security:` security hardening

## Collector requirements

A collector change should:

1. remain read-only unless a requirement explicitly says otherwise;
2. never collect passwords, tokens, private keys or secrets;
3. keep output deterministic and structured where possible;
4. record collection failures as errors/limitations instead of silently hiding them;
5. preserve documented compatibility;
6. produce valid JSON;
7. avoid environment-specific hard-coded values;
8. document new fields or behavioral changes;
9. update the changelog when relevant.

## Pull requests

A PR should state:

- what changed;
- why it changed;
- platforms/versions tested;
- test evidence;
- output/schema impact;
- security impact;
- rollback considerations when applicable.

Do not include real customer output in issues or pull requests.

## License and provenance

Intentionally submitted contributions to the Community core are under
Apache-2.0, subject to Section 5 and any applicable separate agreement.
Contributors must have the rights to submit their work, identify third-party
code and preserve its original license and attribution.

Orizon IT retains the planned CLA process for public contributions. The final
CLA and operational acceptance flow remain a Community Beta prerequisite; this
document does not assert that contributors have already signed an agreement.
No CLA acceptance is required merely to run the Community software.

Do not import proprietary commercial module code into this repository without
explicit authorization and a compatible license grant. See
[licensing and editions](docs/LICENSING_AND_EDITIONS.md).


## Public repository boundary

This repository is public. Contributions must not expose private infrastructure, internal storage locations, customer data, credentials, private repository names, or documentation from unrelated projects/products.

Before opening a pull request:
- keep examples synthetic or sanitized;
- never commit real credentials, private keys, tokens, customer outputs or internal inventories;
- do not reference private storage platforms, internal document locations or non-public repositories;
- do not copy material from unrelated internal projects/products;
- prefer public documentation links and repository-local documentation.

CI includes a repository-boundary check intended to prevent known internal-storage references from being reintroduced.
